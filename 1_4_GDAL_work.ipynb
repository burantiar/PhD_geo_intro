As a library, it presents a single raster abstract data model and single vector abstract data model to the calling application for all supported formats. It also comes with a variety of useful command line utilities for data translation and processing.\n","\n","Official website: https://gdal.org/index.html\n","\n","There is the package for Python: https://pypi.org/project/GDAL/"],"metadata":{"id":"rgL2YfaZxquW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"id":"7V5dNirJ507K"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install osgeo"],"metadata":{"id":"zhAAbWbQ2SNp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"w_1luxaIvV3w"},"outputs":[],"source":["%matplotlib inline\n","from osgeo import gdal_array\n","import gdal\n","from osgeo.gdalnumeric import *\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","## common imports"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"09EQJBrfvV30"},"outputs":[],"source":["np.random.seed(100)\n","\n","directory = '/content/drive/MyDrive/GIS_tutorials/2_python_main_gis_functions/data_package_beg/'\n","fileName = directory + \"out1.tif\"\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"rhJaNBt3vV31"},"outputs":[],"source":["datain = fileName\n","\n","raster_ds = gdal.Open(datain, gdal.GA_ReadOnly)\n","image_gdal = raster_ds.GetRasterBand(1).ReadAsArray() ## get the first band\n","print(image_gdal.shape)\n","\n","plt.imshow(image_gdal)\n","plt.colorbar()\n","plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"stII8U3TvV32"},"outputs":[],"source":["## if we use the shape from above we can demonstrate that satellite images are just really numpy arrays!\n","\n","random_image = np.random.random([2272, 3847])\n","plt.imshow(random_image, interpolation='nearest')\n","plt.colorbar()\n","plt.show()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"NTg3VdFDvV33"},"outputs":[],"source":["## did that prove anything?\n","\n","newimage = (image_gdal * random_image**2) \n","plt.imshow(newimage)\n","plt.show()\n","\n","## does this?
